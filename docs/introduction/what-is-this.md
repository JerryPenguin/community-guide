# Getting started

This website is meant to be a collection of guides for the Ugreen NASync series. The guides are made by the community, and Ugreen themselves.

## Glossary

It will be divided in multiple sections:
  - Introduction (You are here üìç)
  - UGOS guides
    - Custom Docker-based apps
    - Guides to use certain apps
  - Basic hardware guides
    - Not dangerous and easy to archieve, like changing fans or hard drives
  - Advanced Hardware guides
    - To do with caution, it could break something if not done properly
  - Other OS installation guides
    - For the ones that prefer a different OS, you will find happiness here!
    - Could include some more NASync-specific guides for particular OS

But the most important part: if you think something is wrong, or something is missing (a category, a guide, anything), you can [directly contribute](../contributing.md)!
